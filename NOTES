VERSIONS:
	We have adopted the following version format from now on:
							A.B.C.D
	Where C and D are hotfix numbers and A and B are the major versions.

PLUGINS:
	Support for official and user created plugins has been REMOVED entirely.
	The main reason being that implementing or integrating a SECURE plugin 
	framework would be more trouble than its worth.  Something comparable
	may be added in the future.
