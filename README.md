## FAQ


+ *Where can I download Crimson?*

	- Old builds are available in the release repository: [https://github.com/Subterranean-Security/Crimson-Release](https://github.com/Subterranean-Security/Crimson-Release)<br>

+ *What is the history behind Crimson?*
```
Crimson started out as a "sandbox project", but was eventually released in 2014.  During the summer of 2015, Crimson was fully rewritten from scratch and is still very much a work-in-progress.
