**VERSIONS:**<br>
	We have adopted the following version format from now on:<br>
							A.B.C.D<br>
	Where C and D are hotfix numbers and A and B are the major versions.

**PLUGINS:**<br>
	Support for official and user created plugins has been REMOVED entirely.
	The main reason being that implementing or integrating a SECURE plugin 
	framework would be more trouble than its worth.  Something comparable
	may be added in the future.
